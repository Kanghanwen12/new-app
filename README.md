本项目为学习框架结构基本的需求，内容有搭建了路由里面的、权限列表页面删除按钮可以控制路由的显示、以及写了登录提交页面、react-redux、以及axios的封装、
本项目相对于一些不经常写登录、路由的同学提供一些资料，页面简单直接
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
第一次启动前 需要先全局安装json-server工具，可以编写接口数据，最大程度模拟接口，安装方式
npm install -g json-server

启动 json-server --watch db.json
db.json文件我放在了pubilc文件下
然后执行npm start 



The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
